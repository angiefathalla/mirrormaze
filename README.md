Video game for Smart Mirror (Arduino and corresponding hardware required)
As a remedy to the problem of having small children and needing to wait to see the doctor in a physicians office,
they just need some form of entertainment to cut down on incidents of
mischief and or fits, when having a tablet is inaccesible for some parents
which would be in the form of a Smart Mirror with an arcade element.

This code was created for a Smart Mirror and programmed with python on Raspberry Pi 
to hold a Laser Light Detachable Game Frame and capable of reading signals on an Arduino.
